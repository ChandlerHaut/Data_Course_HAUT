Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
No, because they all fall within the parameters of the existing data.

In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
Yes. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-non-linear-model-and-insights-using-r

Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

nf <- read.csv("./non_linear_relationship.csv")

plot1 <- 
nf %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=response))

plot2 <- 
nf %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=predictor))

plot1 + plot2
