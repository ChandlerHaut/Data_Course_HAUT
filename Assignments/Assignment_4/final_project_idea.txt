I would like to look at species of small mammals over time to see the changes in their population sizes. Two types of data I think I could use are physical trapping or acoustic monitoring (this one would be for bats). One data source I already found is uploaded as R1_NABat_VettedObservations_NWRS2022.csv. I have been playing around with it and think it could be cool to be able to show the changes by wildlife refuge. Don't worry I know it is ugly. 

library(tidyverse)
bat <- read_csv('./Data/R1_NABat_VettedObservations_NWRS2022.csv')

p1 <- 
bat %>% 
  filter(!is.na(confirmed)) %>% 
  group_by(CommonName, RefugeName) %>% 
  summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed))

p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= CommonName, y = confirmed))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~RefugeName)+
  theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle = 90))
